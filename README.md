Assignment:
-----------

> Design a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network and have it learn the 
function. Use the interval -1 to 1 in increments of .1 (this gives you 21 total data points.)

> Use the generalized delta rule (backpropagation) weight update  algorithm.  
Run the simulation twice: once with 2 hidden neurons and once with 5 hidden 
neurons. Generate a learning curve (MSE vs iterations) for each case.
